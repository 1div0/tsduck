===================================================
Building TSDuck - The MPEG Transport Stream Toolkit
===================================================

Building tsduck binaries
------------------------

Window:
- Execute PowerShell script build\Build.ps1.

Linux:
- Execute "make" at root level.


Building tsduck installers
--------------------------
There is no need to build the tsduck binaries before building the installers.
Building the binaries, when necessary, is part of the installer build.

Window:
- Execute PowerShell script build\Build-Installer.ps1.

Fedora, CentOS, Red Hat Entreprise Linux:
- Execute "make rpm" at root level.


Pre-requisistes: build tools
----------------------------

Windows:
- Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition
- Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/download.html)
- NSIS, the NullSoft Scriptable Install System (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/)
- CppUnit (https://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit-msvc/files/)
- Optional Dektec DTAPI: Execute PowerShell script dektec\Download-Install-Dtapi.ps1
  It downloads and installs the Dektec Windows SDK from the Dektec site. TSDuck
  project files will detect DTAPI automatically. See msvc2015\msvc-use-dtapi.props
  for details.

Fedora:
- Native build:
  $ dnf install gcc-c++ doxygen pcsc-tools pcsc-lite-devel cppunit-devel
- To build 32-bit on 64-bit system ("make m32"):
  $ dnf install glibc-devel.i686 libstdc++-devel.i686 pcsc-lite-devel.i686 cppunit-devel.i686

CentOS:
- Same as Fedora but use command "yum" instead of "dnf".

Ubuntu:
- Native build:
  $ apt-get install g++ doxygen pcscd libpcsclite-dev libcppunit-dev
- To build 32-bit on 64-bit system ("make m32"), start with:
  $ apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib
  However, there is no 32-bit cross-compiled package for pcsc and cppunit on
  Ubuntu 64-bit. To build a 32-bit TSDuck on Ubuntu 64-bit, first force the
  installation of the 32-bit native (not cross-compiled) 32-bit versions:
  $ apt-get install libpcsclite-dev:i386 libcppunit-dev:i386
  Then build TSDuck ("make m32"). But you can no longer rebuild a 64-bit
  version since the native libraries for pcsc and cppunit were over-written.
  So, you need to reinstall the native 64-bit versions:
  $ apt-get install libpcsclite-dev libcppunit-dev

All Linux:
- Optional Dektec DTAPI: The command "make" at the root level will automatically
  download the LinuxSDK from the Dektec site. See dektec/Makefile for details.

MacOS:
- Install Xcode and its command line utilities.
- To install additional tools from HomeBrew:
  $ brew install pcsc-lite cppunit doxygen gnu-sed grep
